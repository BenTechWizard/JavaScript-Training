// This is an example of a terenary operator

var inputedValue = 25
var age = (inputedValue > 18) ? "Can Purchase Alcohol":"Can Purchase Alcohol";

// This is how it can be utilised

var CTAChange = document.querySelector("CTA of purchase form");
CTAChange.onclick(obj => obj.innerText = age)

// In the example above once the CTA is clicked it lets them know if they are old enough to purchase alcohol
